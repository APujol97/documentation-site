## Authorization
An important part of the security of your application is authorization. You need to control what data which users can access in your app.

Role based access control (RBAC) is the de facto standard for authorization. However, it introduces many complexities for practical applications: roles can be inflexible to change and additional mapping between users and roles must be maintained separately.
