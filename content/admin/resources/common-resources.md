## Suppliers
Each and every supplier works in a different way. Most are old, legacy SOAP APIs, very few are RESTful APIs and none of them is GraphQL. We have developed them all, and ~~suffered~~ learned from all of them. 

We connect seemlessly to more than 600 suppliers.

## Accesses
Each supplier can be accessed in different ways.
