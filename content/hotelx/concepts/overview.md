# Context

_Context_ is the way codes are formed.
Every _platform_ can manage its own contexts or reuse existing ones. 

That is to say, different _sellers_ and _buyers_ can manage same codes _context_. For example [SmyRooms](https://www.smyrooms.com/) uses **SMY** contexts.

_Context_ apply to:

* *Hotel Codes*
* *Board Codes*
* *Room Codes*

Thanks to our built in solution you will be able to choose the context that you want to use when requesting an [HotelX](/hotelx/) operation. This _context_ will be used in order to [map](/hotelx/plugins/mappings) with other _suppliers_ contexts.

We recommend to use the **biggest _context_ possible** or use your **own context**, so all _supplier_ mappings can be resolved.
