## Avail

###  Is possible filter in the availability request by hotel category? 

At the moment is not possible this filter in availability request. Right now the only option is by hotel code. In the future will be possible to request by Destination or by Geocode.

The main search methods will be:
- Hotel code
- Destination (Coming soon)
- Geocode (Coming soon)
