## View our Graph!!

Using [graphql-voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager), we represent [our GraphQL API](https://api.travelgatex.com) as an interactive graph.

##### Features
> * Quick navigation on graph
> * Left panel which provides more detailed information about every type
> * "Skip Relay" option that simplifies graph by removing Relay wrapper classes
> * Ability to choose any type to be a root of the graph
