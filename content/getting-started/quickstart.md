## Four steps to using our API

If you're ready to start searching for a hotel, getting a quote and booking it right away, try out the TravelgateX API by following the steps below:
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Get to know our APIs. Read through our documentation and test some sample calls in our <a href="https://docs.travelgatex.com/getting-started/playground/">API Playground</a>.</p>

<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Sign an agreement with hotel suppliers to be using their booking databases.</p>

<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Sign up for TravelgateX API access. <a href="https://www.travelgatex.com/contact">Send us an email</a> and tell us who you are and which hotel suppliers you are working with. TravelgateX works with over 600 suppliers, and we are the first certified partner to work with Expedia. We will send you a welcome pack with your login details and further guides on how to make your first integration.</p>

<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong> Start generating new business! Read through our integration guides and start integrating our <a href="https://docs.travelgatex.com/hotelx/">HotelX API</a> into your booking applications.</p>

<p><strong>BONUS STEP:</strong> Travelgate is using one of the latest and most advanced API technologies, GraphQL. It is quick to learn and immensely powerful.

### Interactive, user-friendly documentation

All of our endpoint reference documentation is generated from our GraphQL schema. Use the schema column in the navigation of the [Playground](https://api.travelgatex.com) to see and understand what information will be returned by each query.

### Be part of the community

The TravelgateX community of developers are creative, clever, data-driven, fun, and helpful. By being part of our [free community forum](discourse.travelgatex.com), you can contribute to the conversation, learn from other developers working in the travel industry, and share your own best practices and unique insights. Feel connected and be part of a bigger industry sector by participating in our forums. It is also a great place to learn and share new GraphQL practices and to learn about our other tools, including our payments platform, and how other developers are connecting with our 600+ suppliers.

Our developer and support team also actively participates in our forums, so when you post a query, we are quick to respond and solve your integration challenge. The GRaphQL playground has all of our API functionalities baked in, so you can quickly explore making queries and testing calls, but if you need more help, you can post on our forum, or you can contact us through our Jira Service Desk using the username and password that we sent you in your welcome pack. (But don't worry if you can't find it, send us an email and we can send it to you again.)


Although the API has been designed to be very intuitive and easy to read, we are aware that some concepts can be confusing and the process of creating an API overwhelming. That's why we're here to help! You have access to a complete API documentation guide available inside the [Playground](https://api.travelgatex.com), a large community with questions being answered by experienced members to help each other and a support team ready to solve any doubts that you might have during the process.
