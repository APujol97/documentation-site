## Become a TravelgateX Partner

The first step towards building your next travel API is to become a TravelgateX registered partner. 

At this moment, please [contact us](mailto:sales@travelgatex.com) in order to become a partner.

We will be publishing a registration website so each developer can register for an account with us. Please bear with us.

## Product Quick Start

Although there's only one endpoint, our GraphQL API models all the products and services we offer. Please navigate to the desired product documentation in order to start building your app.

- [ConnectX Hotel](/products/connectx/hotel/quickstart/): Next generation hotel search & booking API.
- ConnectX Flights: Next generation _NDC compliant_ flight search & booking API.
- Stats: All the requests sent and received, their response times and status codes.
- Insights: Become a true data-first decision maker by leveraging our rich Insights API. All the requests, all the searches, everything you've made with us available here.
- Mappea: Collaborative Hotel Mapping. Use this API to map your suppliers or to make that everything you have mapped is accurate.

## Get Engaged

You are not alone! The API is designed to be very intuitive and easy to read. Nevertheless, although we strive to keep things simple, some concepts can be confusing and we understand learning a new API can be overwhelming. There are many ways of getting help. The [Playground](https://api.travelgatex.com) contains the API's documentation. As an alternative you can get help from the community or raise a ticket and our support staff will be delighted to solve any doubts, complaints or suggestions you might have.

### Documentation
