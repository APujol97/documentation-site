## Try it now and see how easy it is to use!

If you're ready to start searching for a hotel, getting a quote and booking it right away, try out the TravelgateX API by following the steps below.

### Join the TravelgateX partner program

In order to start building your own API, you'll need to join the TravelgateX partner program. The design of a registration form for developers is already in process but in the meantime you're able to [sign up through us directly](mailto:sales@travelgatex.com) to become a partner.

### Product Quick Start

Choose the desired product from the list with which you'd like to start building your app.

- **[HotelX](/hotelx/)**: Hotel search, booking and content.
- **Stats**: Track the messages sent and received, their response times and status codes.
- **Insights**: Become a true data-first decision maker. All the messages, all the searches, everything you've made with us will be available in Insight.
- **Mappea**: A collaborative Hotel Mapping. Use this API to map your `suppliers` or to make that everything you have mapped is accurate.

### Have a look at the documentation

All the documentation is generated from GraphQL schema. Use the multiple columns navigation of the [Playground](https://api.travelgatex.com) to see and understand what information will be returned by each query.

### Be part of the community

Join our [free community forum](discourse.travelgatex.com) using your TravelgateX username and password. Our community is being run by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) to simplify and give the best experience to our members.

Although the API has been designed to be very intuitive and easy to read, we are aware that some concepts can be confusing and the process of creating an API overwhelming. That's why we're here to help! You have access to a complete API documentation guide available inside the [Playground](https://api.travelgatex.com), a large community with questions being answered by experienced members to help each other and a support team ready to solve any doubts that you might have during the process.

### Can't find your answer?

Get in touch](https://xmltravelgate.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7) through Jira Service Desk using the username and password that has been sent to you together with the welcome pack. Let us know if you haven't received it or can't find it so we can send it to your email address again
