### What is GraphQL?

**GraphQL is a query language for your API**. It was first designed by [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1691455094417024/graphql-a-data-query-language/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com) and it's new way of dealing and managing APIs and specially useful for decoupling client's from server's logic.

>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. <cite>[graphql.org](http://graphql.org/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com)</cite>

>GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. <cite>[graphql.org/learn](http://graphql.org/learn?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com)</cite>

>A GraphQL query is a string that is sent to a server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client. <cite>[Lee Byron, Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1691455094417024/graphql-a-data-query-language/?utm_source=docs.travelgatex.com)</cite>

### GraphQL at TravelgateX

GraphQL is a perfect fit for each and every need of our applications:

- **Scalable**: we must be able to handle millions of requests.
- **Stable**: a change in the API must not break the client.
- **Fast**: GraphQL not only allows faster response times by *letting you choose exactly what you want*, but also is consumes less bandwidth which makes responses lighter.
 
**We are focused in delivering the best APIs to our clients**. SOAP APIs are long gone and modelling REST APIs to fit a vast variety of products is not only hard to understand, it also gets harder to manage as it gets bigger. At TravelgateX, we're true believers of the *Kaisen* philosophy. We're constantly researching for new ways to improve.

>GraphQL allows us to think of our APIs as a whole, giving a coherence in all our products & services, accessible from one single endpoint. It's like a showcase for our APIs.
