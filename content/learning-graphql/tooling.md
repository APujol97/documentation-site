## Tooling

Please find below a collection of tools we've been using to help us develop in GraphQL. We have curated this list with the different goals each of the tools is for:

### Designing Schemas

We follow the **Schema First** methodology. There are many tools, the ones we tried and like most nowadays are:

* APIs Guru's graphql-faker: https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-faker

### Go Packages

Nowadays most our APIS are written in Go, mainly because of speed, ability to handle very high load while using low resources. Also because of the ability to develop plugins. We've used many libraries and packages to help us, hereby our list:

* Redis: https://godoc.org/github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis

### NodeJS Packages

Other pieces of our software are written in NodeJS. Mainly because some packages are wither not avaialble in Go, or because the Go package is not as performant as the Node alternative. These are the packages we use:

### Schema Visualizers

It's nice to be able to _see_ your schema and be able to navigate through it.

* [GraphQL Voyager](https://apis.guru/graphql-voyager/) - Represent any GraphQL API as an interactive graph

### Documentation Generators

Generate beaultiful static documentation sites directly from schema or introspection query

* [Graph Docs](https://graphql-docs.com/docs/?graphqlUrl=http://api-dev.travelgatex.com)
* [Graphdoc](https://github.com/2fd/graphdoc)

### GraphQL Clients

Build, create and play with queries, it's fun!

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/): our favorite &#9825;
* [graphql-playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground): favorite online client
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql): the original
