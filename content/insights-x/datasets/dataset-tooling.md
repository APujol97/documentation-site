# Template reportings

If you don't have your own reporting tool as Tableau or PowerBI, the easiest way to interact with Insights-X datasets is via our free [Google Data Studio Templates](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting). 

We offer free GDS templates to explore our Datasets.
