# Template reportings

If you don't use an own reporting tool as Tableau or PowerBI, the easiest way to interact with Insights-X datasets is via our free [Google Data Studio Templates](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting). 

Every Insights-X Dataset has a free template to explore it:

| Dataset          | Version          | GDS Template  |
| -------------    |:----------------:| -----------:  |
| Partner buyer    | 1.0              |               |
| Partner seller   | 1.0              |               |
| Hotelier         | 1.0              |               |
| Industry partner public | 1.0       |               |
| Industry partner private | 1.0      |               |
