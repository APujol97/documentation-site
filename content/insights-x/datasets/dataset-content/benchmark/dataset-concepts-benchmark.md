## Benchmark
How to interpret the information of the different benchmark tables.
 
### Overview
On this page, you will learn how to interpret the different fields of benchmark table.



First of all, it is important to know that the benchmark is given by 3 periods of time:

* Daily
* Weekly (starts on Monday)
* Monthly

and 3 levels of detail: 

* **General** for TravelgateX.
* By **Destination**.
* By **Seller** if your Organization has a Buyer profile. By **Buyer** if your organization has a Seller profile.


These three levels of detail are displayed in 6 tables, hence offering all the combinations.

From now, we will focus on a seller organization. The case of buyer organization is analogous.

The most specific level of detail is given per *buyer and city*. Here, the benchmark is calculated considering all suppliers in TravelgateX per each city and buyer, this means that you will be able to know different benchmarks for any of your buyers in a specific city. The table that contains that information is `benchmarking\_country\_city\_client\_(daily|weekly|monthly)\_seller`.

The next level of detail is given per *buyer and country*. Here, the benchmark is calculated considering all suppliers in TravelgateX per each country and buyer, this means that you will be able to know different benchmarks for any of your buyers in a specific country. The table that contains that information is `benchmarking\_country\_client\_(daily|weekly|monthly)\_seller`.

The following level of detail in given per *buyer*. Here, the benchmark is calculated considering all suppliers in TravelgateX, this means that you will be able to know different benchmarks for any of your buyers in the globaltmarket of TravelgateX. The table that contains that information is `benchmarking\_client\_(daily|weekly|monthly)\_seller`.

On the other hand, you can check your benchmarks just per *city*. Here, the benchmark is calculated considering all suppliers in TravelgateX per each city. The table that contains that information is `benchmarking\_country\_city\_(daily|weekly|monthly)\_seller`.

The next level of detail is given per *country*. Here, the benchmark is calculated considering all suppliers in TravelgateX per each country. The table that contains that information is `benchmarking\_country\_(daily|weekly|monthly)\_seller`.

Finally, the most general level of detail is given per *provider*. Here, the benchmark is calculated considering all suppliers in TravelgateX. The table that contains that information is `benchmarking\_(daily|weekly|monthly)\_seller`.

As a summary of the information displayed above, the next table sums up the levels of detail for the 6 benchmark tables:

|                     |                                                         Buyer Information                                                         |                                                Not Buyer Information                                               |
|:-------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Destination**     |                          benchmarking\_country\_city\_client\_(daily\|weekly\|monthly)\_seller                                      |  benchmarking\_country\_city\_(daily\|weekly\|monthly)\_seller                                                       |
|                     |                                   benchmarking\_country\_client\_(daily\|weekly\|monthly)\_seller                                   | benchmarking\_country\_(daily\|weekly\|monthly)\_seller                                                              |
| **Not Destination** |                                        benchmarking\_client\_(daily\|weekly\|monthly)\_seller                                       |                                benchmarking\_(daily\|weekly\|monthly)\_seller                               |

Next, we will explain how to interpret the different fields of the table.

### Interpretation 
The benchmark table analyses the total of unique searches per hotel returning availability, the total of confirmed bookings and the total revenue net in euros. These analysis is made by different metrics:

 * The real value:
    + Total of different hotels returning availability: **availability\_value**
    + Total of bookings: **booking\_value**
    + Total of revenue: **revenue\_value**
 * The percentage over total of providers:
    + Percentage over total of different hotels returning availability:  **availability\_percentage** 
    + Percentage over total of bookings: **booking\_percentage**
    + Percentage over total of revenue: **revenue\_percentage**
 * What percentage of suppliers are above me:
    + Percentage of total of providers that are worse than me in available hotels  **availability\_percentile**
    + Percentage of total of providers that are worse than me in bookings: **booking\_percentile**
    + Percentage of total of providers that are worse than me in revenue net: **revenue\_percentile**
 * Position of ranking:
    + Position of the ranking by available hotels considering all sellers in TravelgateX: **availability\_rank**
    + Position of the ranking by my bookings considering all sellers in TravelgateX: **booking\_rank**
    + Position of the ranking by revenue net considering all sellers in TravelgateX: **revenue\_rank**
 * Average per seller (competitive set):
    + Average of all the available hotels per seller: **availability\_compset**
    + Average of all the bookings per seller: **booking\_compset**
    + Average of all the revenue net per seller: **revenue\_compset**
 * How far or how close I am from the best/worst seller. For values near zero, you are close to the worst seller. For values near one, you are close to the best seller:
    + Returning available hotels: **availability\_index**
    + In bookings: **booking\_index**
    + In revenue net: **revenue\_index**

### Examples 
Let's consider the following row from the table `benchmarking\_country\_city\_client\_(daily\|weekly\|monthly)\_seller`:

| client\_id   | provider\_id | country | city           | country\_city\_client         | search\_date             | availability\_value | availability\_percentage | availability\_percentile | availability\_rank | availability\_compset | availability\_index | booking\_value | booking\_percentage | booking\_percentile | booking\_rank | booking\_compset | booking\_index | revenue\_value | revenue\_percentage | revenue\_percentile | revenue\_rank | revenue\_compset | revenue\_index | total\_provider | country\_name         |
