In order to analyze and **produce useful insights**, Insights-X extracts, loads and consolidates data from products like Hotel-X.  

Once the data is consolidated in our Datawarehouse, we can share data depending on partner's TravelgateX relationship:

* **Partners:** already connected to our platform, such as OTAs and Wholesalers, will have access to accurate data regarding their performance, ratios, prices, product usage... With these insights an accurate benchmarking against competitors is made clear so that our partners can gain a competitive advantage. _We do this without ever exposing our partnersâ€™ data because we use anonymous competitive sets_. 
 
* **Hoteliers:** which can be connected or not to our platform, will also have access to benchmarking information, discover KPIs such ADR and supplier-client demand, which will help to maximize room revenue.

* **Other Industry partners:** not connected to our platform, can have access to insights about segmentation, profitability and demand across global markets. This data will help you forecast your own needs
