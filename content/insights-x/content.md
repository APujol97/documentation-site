*What is the performance of your infrastructure? What hotelier product is being requested and booked around the world? How are you doing with respect to your competitors?*

**Knowledge is power** and that's what the product **Insights-X** offers, based on more than 2 billion search requests and more than 20,000 bookings per day.

In order to answer the three previous questions, the product has been designed in three sections, which are explained below:

## Performance
This first section answers the question of: **What is the performance of your infrastructure?** 
Here you will be able to know in detail the performance of your requests for searches, quotes, bookings and cancellations. You will know the status of your requests, what types of errors are you receiving, what times per request you are handling. Find out more about performance [here](/insights-x/datasets/dataset-content/performance/).

## Insights
This second part answers the question of: **What hotelier product is being requested and booked around the world?**
Here you will be able to know in detail the information of the Searches and the characteristics of the bookings through TravelgateX, the global marketplace for the travel trade. Hotels, destinations, markets and prices are only a part of the information that you will enjoy with Insights-X. Find out more about Insights [here](/insights-x/datasets/dataset-content/insights/).

## Benchmark
Finally, with Benchmark we offer you the **competitive advantage** of knowing **how you are doing with respect to the competition**.
The comparisons are based on the number of available hotels, total of bookings and net revenue, plus you will be able to see your position with respect to other competitors filtering at country level, city and clients/suppliers adding the possibility of fixing your competitive set.
