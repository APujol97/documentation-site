How does your infrastructure perform? What hotelier product is being requested and booking around the world? How are you doing with respect to your competitors?

Knowledge is power and that's what the product **Insights-X** of TravelgateX offers, based on more than 2 billion search requests and more than 20,000 bookings per day.

In order to answer the three previous questions, the product has been designed in three parts, which we explain below:

With it you will be able to know in detail the performance of your requests for searches, quotes, bookings and cancellations. You will know the status of your requests, what types of errors are you receiving, what times per request
 you're handling. Find out more about perfomance in [link dataset perfomance]
