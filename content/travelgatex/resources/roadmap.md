We have put together a GitHub Project where we will keep updating on the things weâ€™ve in our plans.

[Here](https://github.com/orgs/travelgateX/projects/4) is the GitHub project with Public Roadmap of TravelgateX.

The Project has a few columns that act as the status whereas cards are the items that we have in our plans. We have also labelled each issue so it would clarify if the item would be added in the HotelX, Documentation, etc...
