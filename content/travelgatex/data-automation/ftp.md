## Introduction

SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a network protocol that provides completely secure access, transfer, and management of data files programmatically. This protocol is used by the largest organizations in Finance, Technology, and Consulting to transfer data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to ensure it remains 100% secure.

## Security

To ensure the security of your data, we adhere to the highest standards in data security. The advanced security measures we take include:

* **Password-based** authentication.
* **IP Whitelisting**: We whitelist the IP Addresses you will be accessing your SFTP server from to ensure you, and only you, have access.
* **Anomaly Detection**: To ensure no loss of data, we detect anomalies in your uploads to the SFTP server and warn you when an upload would significantly change your account.
* **Encryption**: Data is encrypted, keeping your information safe and private.

## Setup

To get your FTP Credential Details raise a _customer care request_ in [Jira Service Desk](/getting-started/quickstart/#jira-service-desk).
