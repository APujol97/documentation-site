## Overview

ConnectX introduces a new concept to the industry: Plugins.
In a nutshell, a plugin is a piece of code that _is executed inside our application_. There are a few points in the request lifetime where anyone can develop a plugin. It receives the request _or response_ as an input and outputs the _changed_ request _or response_.
Plugins are a core package in the [Go Programming language](https://golang.org/) and more info about it can be found [here](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/).

For more information and how to write and build plugins please go to the relevant ConnectX Plugin Documentation Page: [Hotel](/connectx/hotel/plugins/) or [Flight](/connectx/flight/plugins/).
