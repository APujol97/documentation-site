TravelgateX offers a set of [Products](/product) ready to be integrated using a single [GraphQL](/graphql-api/) endpoint.

## GraphQL API
TravelgateX is the first-in-the-industry travel API completely based in GraphQL. Most travel APIs are old legacy XML Soap APIs. We know that, because we've integrated too many of them. The problems with that technology are well-known and we won't get into details here. One of the things we really like about GraphQL, is that each client is ultimately responsible over what it wants to be returned. 

It is a stable, secure and fault tolerant load balanced between many datacenters from 4 different cloud providers, namely [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.de/) and [TotalUptime](http://totaluptime.com/).
